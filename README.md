This project is intended to show how encryption does not have to be complicated.

the prototype folder is the source code of a simple one time pad encryption scheme that I wrote
when I had very little knowledge of programming. It is poorly written and in some places incorrect
however, I want to demonstrate how it is not dificult to create a functional prototype.

the oneTimePad folder contains a NetBeans project where I re-wrote(and improved) the prototype
into a single file for demonstration puropses.
